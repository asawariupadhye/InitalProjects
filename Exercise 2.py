## Problem Statement : Ask a user their weight(in pounds), convert it to kilograms and
##out put it to the terminal

weight_in_pounds = input("What is your weight in lbs ")
weight_in_kgs = float(weight_in_pounds) * 0.45

print("Your weight in kilograms is " + str(weight_in_kgs))

## you see two conversions in this code, one after accepting the string input and the other
##when you are printing the float calculation as a string to the terminal at the end.
